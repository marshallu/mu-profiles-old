MU Profiles
===

MU Profiles is a WordPress plugin developed by the Office of University Communications for use on the Marshall University website. The plugin is designed to work with the university WordPress theme, [Marsha](www.marshall.edu/marsha/).

# Departments

The first step in setting up MU Profiles on your website is to create at least one Department by going into your WordPress dashboard and going to `Profiles > All Departments`. From there you can create a new Department and give it a name. You can create as many Departments as needed.

There are a couple custom options created for Departments that will change how your content will be displayed:
- **Listing Display** - This overrides the sitewide Department display setting and controls how this single Department's listings will be displayed on your website. You can learn more about Display Options below.
- **Hide Departments** - You may encounter a time where you do not want the Department displayed on Department listings or on Profile pages. If this box is checked, it will hide this specific department on all listings and profiles.

## Display Layouts
There are currently three display layouts available as part of this plugin:
- **Table** - This will display your listings in an HTML table with the person's Name, Title, Office, Phone Number, and Email (optionally) displayed. This is the default method. This is an example: https://www.marshall.edu/cob/directory/deans-office/
- **Enhanced** - This will display a listing on the page that includes a person's Photo, Name, Title, Department, Email, and Phone Number. This is an example: https://www.marshall.edu/atc/directory/staff/.
- **Row** - This will display the listing on the page that includes a person's Photo, Name, Title, Office Location, Email, Phone,  and a column on the right for a listing of a person's responsibilities. This is an example: https://www.marshall.edu/ucomm/contact/.

# Profiles
Once you have created at least one Department you can start creating Profiles for individuals by going into your WordPress dashboard and going to `Profiles > All Departments`.

Information that is required for the Profile are just the name and position, everything else is optional. If a piece of information is not added it will not show up on the Profile page.

## Lists
There are some default lists available including Education, Awards, Scholarship, etc. If no entries are added to those lists they will not show up on the Profile page.

**Note:** The **Contact For** list will only display when the **Row** display is selected and will not display on the Profile page only on the Department listing.

At the bottom under **Lists** you have the option to create any number of custom lists that fit your department's needs/requirements.
